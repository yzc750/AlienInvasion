# AlienInvasion
This is a practice of Alien Invasion project.
This project is provided by the book written by Eric Matthes.
I started this practice on 9th Nov. 2019 and finished it on 27th Nov. 2019.

Tips to use these files:
#! Python 3.7
I created a virtual environment folder named "alien_invasion" in my own computer to run this project.
The site-package "pygame" is required to be installed for this project.
The "ship.bmp" & "alien.bmp" should be put in a floder named "Images" under the "alien_invasion" folder.
